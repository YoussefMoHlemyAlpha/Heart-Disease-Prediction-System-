# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System:-
This project is a heart disease prediction system that preprocesses data, trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and uses a web interface for predictions. It includes data cleaning, outlier removal, model training, and serialization using pickle. A Streamlit app enables users to input patient data and receive predictions on the likelihood of heart disease.
